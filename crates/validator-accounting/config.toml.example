# Default: true

# jitoSOL to SOL exchange rate for valuation
# jitoSOL typically trades at ~1.05-1.15x SOL due to accumulated staking rewards.
# Default: 1.0 (conservative for accounting)
# Set to a realistic value like 1.10 for more accurate revenue reporting.

# Note: BAM rewards are jitoSOL tokens claimed to the validator identity's
# associated token account. The identity pubkey from [validator] section is used
# for API queries. Make sure it's the IDENTITY pubkey, not the vote account.
# Only actually claimed rewards are recorded (unclaimed eligibility is skipped).
